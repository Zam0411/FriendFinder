# FriendFinder

The purpose of this app was to use both node.js and express to deploy a site using Heroku.
Within the site you will be prompted to fill out a name and a photo of yourself and then by answering 10 questions listed within the site
you will be matched with a new friend with like minded ideas based on the results of your answers.

Here is the link to the live site on Heroku:
